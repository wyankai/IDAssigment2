## Daily To Do List Website

This is a to do list website that uses localStorage to store the user's daily tasks. This website is meant to kept in the background while the user work to completing their daily tasks. User's can also edit their daily tasks. The website also uses a Quotable API which provides the users with quotes to motivate them while they do their tasks

## Design Process
 
The design is for the people who want to use a personalised to-do list.
The website stores the user's input into the localStorage so that the User's data would not be lost the moment they reload the screen.

-As the creator of the websote, I want to create a platform for the users for them to store their todo-list as well as badges function and a chart function to help show the users how productive they are.

## Features

Feature 1: To-do List that uses localStorage so the the users will not lose their to-do list the moment they refresh the page.
Feature 2: History Button that shows the users the tasks that they have already completed.
Feature 3: Completed button can be pressed again in case the user accidentally pressed the completed button
Feature 4: Badges button that shows the Users the achievement they have unlocked.
Feature 5: Settings button that allow the users to toggle Light and Dark Mode.
Feature 6: Light and Dark Mode that uses localStorage so that mode will still be on even after the user had reloaded the page.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1: To-do List
- Feature 2: Settings Section

### Features Left to Implement
- ChartJS API
- History Button
- Badges in the badges section

## Technologies Used
- HTML

-CSS

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
